<p>
Hi. Iâ€™m Mario, a computer engineer from Milan, Italy. Please take a look around!
</p>

<p>My computer adventure begins in the 90s when I got a Commodore 64.
Then gave me a 386, a 486, a Pentium 166. I liked disassemble and assemble my computers.
The first programming language I learned was the Visual Basic 6, I bought a book at the bookstore. It was 2002.</p>

<p>
So I got a master degree in Computer Engineering.
</p>

<p>
In my free time I like to work on some of my projects, always trying to keep me updated on the latest technologies. I am currently studying HADOOP.
</p>

<p>
I like opensource, Java (web framework as Struts 2 and desktop), Android but also commercial product as .NET framework (C#/WPF).
</p>

<p>
I like everything about the computer networks. Create socket, server, chat, streming of media (RTP, RTMP, HTTP). I know WebM, MP4 and FLV video codec.
</p>

<p>
I know various databases: MySQL, ORACLE, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL Server 2005+, SQLite. 
I know the technologies for data persistence: Hibernate, NHibernate, JDO, Entity Framework.
</p>

<p>
I know MONO to run .NET application on Linux and MAC system. I have successfully created a porting of an application server from .NET to MONO, to execute on Ubuntu.
</p>

<p>
I like Linux system, in particulars: Ubuntu and Fedora.
</p>

<p>
I have experience on cloud technologies: Amazon Web Services (S3, EC2, RDS, CloudFront), Windows Azure and Google AppEngine.
